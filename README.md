This is a personal take on augmented reality with Unity and Vuforia. I have decided to work on this as an experiment with marker based AR and see what i can evolve into.

Initial Upload:
- It has been integrated with Vuforia.
- It has component from a spectrum visualizer.
- Goal for next step: build a interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Update 1/13/2016:
- added simple UI to change spectrum visualizer's color
- added simple particle
- fixed spectrum bar so they are aligned with the ground
- changed spectrum movement to lerp, smooth out the animation.
